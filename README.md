How the fuck does anybody thing .git is actually intuitive?

For example, in the shitty tutorial located here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ step 2 says to "Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: main."  Well, you could spend a lifetime looking for that because it doesn't fucking exist.  Luckily underneath step 4 there is an anigif showing that you must click branch-master.  To coin a British term, it seems that .git is run by gits.
